## **Phase 0: Preparation & Setup**

1. Initialize GitHub Repository  
   * Create a new repo with README.md describing project goals.  
   * Add core documentation files: project\_requirements.md, implementation\_plan.md, design\_guidelines.md, baseprompt.md, comprehensive\_debugging\_manual.md.  
   * Commit and push initial structure.  
2. Create Base Prompt File  
   * Write baseprompt.md with the foundational prompt guiding Lovableâ€™s behavior (see updated base prompt).  
   * Commit to GitHub.  
3. Set Up Supabase Project  
   * Create Supabase account and new project.  
   * Configure authentication (disable email confirmation if desired).  
   * Define database schema for experiments, prompts, capabilities, actions, intents, outcome metrics, users, API keys.  
   * Configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection.  
4. Connect Lovable to GitHub and Supabase  
   * Link Lovable project to GitHub repo.  
   * Connect Lovable to Supabase project for auth and data storage.

## **Phase 1: Core Backend & Data Layer**

1. Design & Implement Database Schema  
   * Tables: experiments, prompts, capabilities, actions, intents, outcome\_metrics, users, api\_keys, experiment\_results.  
   * Include versioning fields and audit trails.  
   * Define relationships and constraints (foreign keys, unique constraints).  
2. API Layer Development  
   * Build RESTful/GraphQL APIs for:  
     * Experiment CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  
     * Prompt and configuration management  
     * Capability and action registration  
     * Outcome metric ingestion and querying  
     * User authentication and API key management  
   * Secure APIs with authentication and role-based access control.  
3. LLM Provider Integration  
   * Implement connectors for GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, etc. using API keys.  
   * Abstract LLM calls behind a unified interface for easy switching/testing.  
4. Outcome Metric Integration Pipelines  
   * Build connectors to ingest metrics from CRM, CSAT, analytics platforms (via APIs or manual upload).  
   * Normalize and store metrics linked to experiments, capabilities, and intents.

## **Phase 2: Frontend & User Experience**

1. Experiment Creation UI  
   * React-based form to create/edit experiments with fields: prompt text, config params, LLM model, capability, actions, intent.  
   * Support version control, branching UI elements, and approval workflows.  
   * Guided onboarding wizard reflecting user journey steps.  
2. Dashboard & Analytics Views  
   * Real-time experiment performance dashboard with filters by capability, intent, LLM model.  
   * Historical comparison charts and tables.  
   * Drill-down views for action-level metrics and logs.  
   * Prediction overlays and anomaly alerts.  
3. API Key & User Management UI  
   * Interface for users to add/manage LLM API keys securely.  
   * User profile and role management with fine-grained permissions.  
4. Admin Portal  
   * User and experiment governance tools.  
   * Audit logs and version timelines.  
   * Approval and collaboration features (comments, notifications).

## **Phase 3: Integration & Automation**

1. Integration APIs & Webhooks  
   * Expose APIs for external systems to programmatically create/update experiments and metrics.  
   * Implement webhook/event callbacks for real-time notifications and automation triggers.  
2. Intent Detection Integration  
   * Provide hooks to ingest intent labels from upstream NLU or LLM-based classifiers.  
   * Store and use intent data for filtering and attribution.  
3. Rollback & Iteration Workflows  
   * Implement UI and backend support for fast rollback at experiment, capability, action, or intent level.  
   * Support experiment forking and branching workflows.

## **Phase 4: Testing, Debugging & Deployment**

1. Testing Strategy  
   * Unit tests for backend APIs and database operations.  
   * Integration tests for LLM provider connectors and metric pipelines.  
   * End-to-end tests for UI workflows.  
   * Load and performance testing for scalability.  
2. Debugging & Monitoring  
   * Upload comprehensive debugging manual to GitHub and configure Lovable to reference it.  
   * Implement logging and error tracking for API calls and UI errors.  
   * Set up monitoring dashboards for system health and anomaly detection.  
3. Deployment Setup  
   * Configure Vercel deployment with vercel.json to route all paths to /.  
   * Deploy frontend and backend services.  
   * Set up environment variables securely (API keys, DB credentials).  
4. PWA Enablement (Optional)  
   * Implement Progressive Web App features for offline support and native-like experience.  
   * Test on multiple devices and browsers.

## **Phase 5: Documentation & Handoff**

1. User Documentation  
   * Write user guides for experiment creation, metric assignment, dashboard usage, rollback.  
   * Document API usage and integration instructions.  
2. Developer Documentation  
   * Document database schema, API specs, deployment steps, and debugging procedures.  
3. Training & Enablement  
   * Conduct walkthroughs and training sessions for product managers, prompt engineers, ops, and developers.
