## **1\. Problem Statement**

Teams building AI-powered products with LLMs face a critical attribution challenge:  
They cannot clearly isolate which prompt changes, LLM configurations, model versions, or workflow actions impact real-world customer outcomes. This opacity leads to:

* Slower iteration cycles and innovation  
* Difficulty diagnosing issues or regressions  
* Inefficient collaboration across product, engineering, and operations teams  
* Challenges integrating experimentation into existing codebases and APIs

This platform solves the attribution and integration problem by enabling teams to create, manage, and evaluate LLM experiments tied explicitly to outcome metrics, while seamlessly plugging into any company’s existing code and API infrastructure.

## **2\. User Roles & Needs**

| Role | Primary Goals / Needs |
| ----- | ----- |
| Product Manager | Ship new AI behaviors and measure their success clearly and quickly. |
| Prompt Engineer | Test multiple prompt variations and identify winning versions efficiently. |
| Operations / CS | Diagnose if customer issues are tied to specific AI configurations or prompt changes. |
| Engineer | Track and compare how different LLMs behave in production; integrate platform APIs into existing systems. |
| Enablement | Standardize testing, feedback, and iteration workflows across teams to improve collaboration and adoption. |

## **3\. Core Features**

### **3.1 Experiment Creation**

* Define experiments specifying:  
  * Prompt text and variations  
  * Configuration parameters  
  * LLM model selection (GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, etc.) via API keys  
  * Capability (high-level functional goal, e.g., “BookAppointment”)  
  * Actions (discrete workflow steps, e.g., “UserLookup”, “GetAvailability”, “BookAppointment”)  
* Support version control, branching, and forking of experiments.

### **3.2 Outcome Metric Assignment**

* Assign outcome metrics to experiments and segment by capability and intent.  
* Metrics sourced from:  
  * Internal systems (CRM, CSAT, analytics platforms) via API integrations or manual input.  
* Examples: conversion rate, resolution time, user sentiment, latency.

### **3.3 Intent Integration**

* Explicitly tag experiments and outcomes with user intents (e.g., “ScheduleMeeting”, “CheckBalance”).  
* Ingest intent labels from upstream NLU systems or LLM-based classification.  
* Enable filtering and analytics by intent.

### **3.4 Real-Time Tracking & Historical Comparison**

* Visualize experiment performance in real-time dashboards.  
* Compare current results against historical baselines to detect improvements or regressions.

### **3.5 Fast Rollback & Iteration**

* Quick rollback to previous prompt/config versions at capability, action, or intent granularity.  
* Fork experiments to try new variations without losing history.

### **3.6 Multi-LLM Support via API Keys**

* Seamlessly switch or test across multiple LLM providers.  
* Secure API key management within the platform.

### **3.7 Integration & Management APIs**

* Provide RESTful/GraphQL APIs to plug into any company’s existing codebase or backend.  
* Programmatic creation, update, monitoring of experiments, capabilities, actions, intents, and outcome metrics.  
* Webhook/event callbacks for real-time notifications and automation.

### **3.8 Experiment & Configuration Lifecycle Management**

* Versioning and audit trails for experiments, prompts, and configurations.  
* Experiment states: Draft, Active, Paused, Archived.  
* Approval workflows and governance controls.  
* Collaboration features: comments, notifications, and annotations.

### **3.9 Operational Monitoring & Alerts**

* Real-time system health dashboards (API usage, error rates, latency).  
* Configurable anomaly detection and alerting.  
* One-click rollback and impact analysis tools.

### **3.10 User Onboarding & Help**

* Guided setup wizards for experiment creation and integration.  
* Contextual help, tooltips, and embedded documentation.  
* Access to comprehensive debugging manuals and prompt templates.

## **4\. Platform Requirements**

### **4.1 API Integrations**

* Support GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, and other LLMs via API keys.  
* Integrate with CRM, CSAT, analytics systems for outcome metric imports.  
* Open APIs for seamless integration into customer codebases and workflows.

### **4.2 Custom Prompt Templates**

* Create, save, and reuse prompt templates with variable inputs.

### **4.3 Outcome Metric Imports**

* Manual entry and automated pipelines to pull metrics from internal systems.

### **4.4 Admin Portals & CRM Support**

* Admin portals for user, API key, and experiment governance.  
* Optional CRM/support system integration for richer outcome data.

### **4.5 Security & Authentication**

* Secure API key management.  
* User authentication and role-based access control (e.g., via Supabase).  
* Fine-grained permissions and audit logging.

### **4.6 Frontend Technology & Deployment**

* Frontend built with React, leveraging component-driven architecture and React Query for data fetching.  
* Backend powered by Supabase for authentication, database, and real-time data.  
* Deployment on Vercel with SPA routing configured via vercel.json.  
* Optional Progressive Web App (PWA) support for native-like experience.

## **5\. Success Metrics**

| Metric Name | Description | Use Case Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Call Conversion % | Percentage of calls converted to sales or actions | Measure prompt impact on sales calls |
| Resolution Time | Average time to resolve customer issues | Track efficiency improvements |
| LLM Latency | Response time of LLM to prompts | Monitor performance and user experience |
| Deflection Rate | Rate of customer issues resolved without escalation | Evaluate prompt effectiveness |
| Escalation Frequency | How often issues escalate to human agents | Detect prompt failures or gaps |
| User Sentiment | Customer feedback (thumbs up/down, ratings) | Measure qualitative success |
| Dashboard Load Time | Time to load analytics dashboards | Ensure \< 3 seconds for good UX |
| Data Freshness | Latency between data generation and display | Real-time or near real-time (\< 1 min) |
| User Engagement | Frequency of dashboard use by roles | Track adoption and identify training needs |

## **6\. Scalability and Reliability Considerations**

* Support growing numbers of experiments, users, and data volume without performance degradation.  
* Efficient data storage and retrieval for real-time and historical analytics.  
* Robust error handling and logging for API calls and data pipelines.  
* Fast rollback mechanisms to minimize impact of bad prompt/config changes.  
* Secure management of API keys and user authentication.  
* Monitoring and alerting for anomalies in experiment performance or system health.

## **7\. User Journey Summary**

* User starts via dashboard CTA or onboarding wizard.  
* Defines the outcome they want to track and improve.  
* Selects an experiment template (Intent \> Prompt \> Outcome, or Intent \> Capabilities \+ Actions \+ Prompt \> Outcome, etc.).  
* Configures intents, capabilities, actions, prompts, and integrations step-by-step with guided UI.  
* Reviews and confirms setup with visual flow diagrams.  
* Lovable generates and deploys a custom LLM edge function build plan.  
* User monitors real-time analytics, receives alerts, and iterates with rollback support.
