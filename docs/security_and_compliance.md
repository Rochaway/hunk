# **Security & Compliance Checklist**

Project: LLM Experimentation & Attribution Platform  
Purpose: Ensure the platform meets essential security standards and compliance requirements to protect data, maintain user trust, and support scalable operations.

---

## **1\. Authentication & Access Control**

*  Implement user authentication via Supabase with secure password policies.  
*  Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) with clearly defined roles (Admin, Product Manager, Prompt Engineer, Operations, Viewer).  
*  Apply fine-grained permissions at experiment, API key, and data level.  
*  Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin and sensitive roles (if supported).  
*  Maintain audit logs of all user logins, role changes, and critical actions.

---

## **2\. API Key & Credential Management**

*  Store all API keys and credentials encrypted at rest.  
*  Limit API key visibility based on user roles.  
*  Support API key rotation and revocation workflows without downtime.  
*  Monitor API key usage and alert on suspicious activity or quota breaches.

---

## **3\. Data Privacy & Protection**

*  Mask or redact sensitive data in logs, UI, and reports.  
*  Comply with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) regarding user data handling.  
*  Implement data retention and deletion policies configurable by admins.  
*  Secure data in transit using TLS/HTTPS for all API and UI communications.

---

## **4\. Infrastructure & Deployment Security**

*  Deploy frontend and backend on secure platforms (Vercel, Supabase) with up-to-date security patches.  
*  Configure firewalls and network security groups to restrict access to backend services.  
*  Use environment variables for secrets and credentials; avoid hardcoding.  
*  Enable logging and monitoring for infrastructure health and security events.

---

## **5\. Application Security**

*  Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.  
*  Use secure coding practices in React frontend and backend APIs.  
*  Protect against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).  
*  Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.

---

## **6\. Experiment & Data Governance**

*  Maintain version control and audit trails for all experiments, prompts, and configurations.  
*  Enforce approval workflows for production deployment of experiments.  
*  Provide collaboration controls with comments and notifications while preserving data integrity.  
*  Enable data export controls with permission checks.

---

## **7\. Monitoring & Incident Response**

*  Set up real-time monitoring dashboards for API usage, error rates, and latency anomalies.  
*  Configure alerting mechanisms (email, Slack, webhooks) for security incidents and operational issues.  
*  Define and document incident response procedures for data breaches or service disruptions.  
*  Regularly review logs and alerts for suspicious activity.

---

## **8\. Compliance & Documentation**

*  Document all security policies, procedures, and controls.  
*  Provide user training and enablement on security best practices.  
*  Maintain compliance evidence for audits (logs, access records, change management).  
*  Review and update security measures periodically.
