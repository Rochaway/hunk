# **Performance Testing Plan**

Project: LLM Experimentation & Attribution Platform  
Purpose: Define testing strategies, benchmarks, and monitoring to ensure the platform performs reliably and scales with user and data growth.

---

## **1\. Testing Objectives**

* Validate system responsiveness under expected and peak loads.  
* Ensure real-time analytics dashboards update within acceptable latency (\<3 seconds).  
* Confirm API endpoints handle concurrent requests without degradation.  
* Verify database queries perform efficiently with growing data volumes.  
* Test rollback and experiment branching workflows for performance impact.  
* Identify bottlenecks in LLM provider integrations and outcome metric ingestion pipelines.

## **2\. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

| KPI | Target / Threshold | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Dashboard Load Time | \< 3 seconds | Time to fully render analytics dashboards. |
| API Response Time | \< 500 ms (95th percentile) | Backend API latency under normal load. |
| Concurrent Users | Support 1000+ simultaneous users | Number of users performing experiments/analytics concurrently. |
| Data Freshness Latency | \< 1 minute | Delay between data generation and dashboard update. |
| Rollback Execution Time | \< 5 seconds | Time to rollback experiment to previous version. |
| Error Rate | \< 0.1% | Percentage of failed API calls or UI errors. |

## **3\. Testing Types & Tools**

### **3.1 Load Testing**

* Simulate concurrent users performing experiment creation, editing, and analytics queries.  
* Tools: JMeter, k6, or Locust.

### **3.2 Stress Testing**

* Push system beyond expected peak loads to identify breaking points.  
* Monitor system recovery and degradation patterns.

### **3.3 End-to-End Testing**

* Automate UI workflows including experiment lifecycle and analytics dashboard interactions.  
* Tools: Cypress, Playwright.

### **3.4 API Performance Testing**

* Benchmark REST/GraphQL endpoints for throughput and latency.  
* Tools: Postman, Apache Bench.

### **3.5 Database Performance**

* Test query performance on large datasets with indexing and caching strategies.  
* Tools: pgbench (for Postgres/Supabase).

## **4\. Test Environment Setup**

* Mirror production environment with Supabase backend, React frontend, and Vercel deployment.  
* Use realistic data volumes and experiment counts.  
* Include LLM provider mocks or sandbox APIs to simulate response times.

---

## **5\. Monitoring & Reporting**

* Integrate monitoring tools (e.g., Grafana, Datadog) to track KPIs in real-time.  
* Set up alerts for KPI breaches during tests.  
* Generate detailed reports with bottleneck analysis and recommendations.

---

## **6\. Continuous Performance Testing**

* Automate performance tests as part of CI/CD pipeline.  
* Run tests on every major release or configuration change.  
* Use results to guide optimizations and capacity planning.
