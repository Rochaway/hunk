# **Configuration & Management Guide**

Project: LLM Experimentation & Attribution Platform  
Purpose: Guide for managing experiments, API keys, user roles, and configurations within the platform to ensure operational simplicity, security, and scalability.

---

## **1\. Experiment Lifecycle Management**

### **1.1 Versioning & History**

* Every experiment, prompt, and configuration must have version control.  
* Users can view change history with timestamps and author info.  
* Support diff views to compare versions side-by-side.

### **1.2 Experiment States**

* Experiments have lifecycle states:  
  * Draft: Work in progress, not live.  
  * Active: Running and collecting data.  
  * Paused: Temporarily stopped, can resume.  
  * Archived: Completed or deprecated, read-only.

### **1.3 Approval & Governance**

* Changes to experiments require approval workflows for production deployment.  
* Admins can configure approval rules and assign approvers.  
* Audit logs track approvals, rejections, and comments.

### **1.4 Collaboration**

* Enable comments and annotations on experiments and prompts.  
* Notify relevant users on changes or issues via email or in-app alerts.

---

## **2\. API Key & Credential Management**

### **2.1 Secure Storage**

* Store API keys encrypted at rest.  
* Limit visibility based on user roles.

### **2.2 Rotation & Revocation**

* Support key rotation workflows without downtime.  
* Allow immediate revocation of compromised keys.

### **2.3 Usage Monitoring**

* Track API key usage metrics (calls, errors, latency).  
* Alert on unusual activity or quota breaches.

---

## **3\. User Roles & Permissions**

### **3.1 Role Definitions**

* Admin: Full access including user and key management.  
* Product Manager: Manage experiments, view analytics.  
* Prompt Engineer: Create and edit prompts and experiments.  
* Operations: Monitor system health and troubleshoot.  
* Viewer: Read-only access to dashboards and reports.

### **3.2 Fine-Grained Access**

* Permissions enforced at UI and API levels.  
* Experiment-level access control for sensitive projects.  
* Ability to assign multiple roles per user.

---

## **4\. Environment & Deployment Configuration**

### **4.1 Multi-Environment Support**

* Support separate environments: Development, Staging, Production.  
* Allow experiments to be promoted or rolled back across environments.

### **4.2 Deployment Settings**

* Configure edge function deployment parameters (timeouts, memory).  
* Manage feature flags and rollout percentages.

---

## **5\. Template & Reusable Component Management**

### **5.1 Prompt Templates**

* Create, save, and version prompt templates with variable placeholders.  
* Share templates across teams or restrict by role.

### **5.2 Capabilities & Actions Library**

* Maintain a library of reusable capabilities and actions.  
* Version control and documentation for each component.

---

## **6\. Operational Monitoring & Alerts**

### **6.1 Health Dashboards**

* Real-time views of API usage, error rates, latency, and system status.

### **6.2 Anomaly Detection**

* Configurable thresholds for key metrics.  
* Automated alerts via email, Slack, or webhook.

### **6.3 Rollback & Recovery**

* One-click rollback to last known good configuration.  
* Impact analysis before rollback.

---

## **7\. User Onboarding & Help**

### **7.1 Guided Setup Wizards**

* Step-by-step flows for experiment creation and integration setup.  
* Contextual help and examples at each step.

### **7.2 Documentation Access**

* Embedded links to user guides, API docs, and debugging manuals.  
* Searchable FAQ and troubleshooting tips.

---

## **8\. Security & Compliance**

### **8.1 Audit Logging**

* Record all user actions, configuration changes, and access events.

### **8.2 Data Privacy**

* Mask sensitive data in logs and UI.  
* Comply with data retention and deletion policies.

---

## **9\. Summary**

This guide ensures that the platformâ€™s management and configuration features are:

* Secure and compliant with role-based access and audit trails.  
* User-friendly with guided onboarding and contextual help.  
* Robust and scalable with versioning, approval workflows, and operational monitoring.  
* Collaborative with comments, notifications, and reusable component libraries.
