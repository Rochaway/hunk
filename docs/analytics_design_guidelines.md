## **1\. Overview**

This document defines the visual and interaction design standards for the Analytics Dashboard of the LLM Experimentation & Attribution Platform. The goal is to provide a simple, intuitive, and powerful interface that enables product, engineering, and operations teams to:

* Attribute changes and improvements to variables, actions, capabilities, and intents.  
* Understand customer journey from intent to outcome with granular filtering.  
* Overlay trends and compare multiple metrics.  
* Predict future outcomes based on historical data.  
* Quickly drill down into problematic areas for diagnosis.
