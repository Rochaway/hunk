# **Lovable Prompts Directory For Project Hunk README**

Welcome to the /lovable-prompts/ directory\! This folder contains all the core prompt templates and instructions used to guide Lovable through the iterative development, debugging, planning, and deployment of the LLM Experimentation & Attribution Platform.

---

## **Purpose**

These prompts serve as the source of truth for Lovable’s conversational and coding behavior. They ensure:

* Consistent understanding of project scope and tech stack.  
* Structured, step-by-step planning and approvals.  
* Systematic debugging and error resolution.  
* Clear guidance on UI/UX, analytics, security, and performance.  
* Smooth onboarding and user-friendly flows.  
* Secure and compliant development practices.

\#\# How to Use

\- Lovable should be instructed to load and reference these prompt files contextually.

\- Use the base prompt (\`/lovable-prompts/base\_prompt.md\`) to start conversations with Lovable.

\- Refer to the debugging manual for troubleshooting.

\- Follow the implementation plan for step-by-step build guidance.
